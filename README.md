# 1. Welcome to React
## 1. Warming up

Goals:
- What is a component?
- What is JSX? How is it different from html?
    - `className` over `class`
    - `style` is an object (not a string). 
    - `{}` for attributes rather than `""`.
    - `camelCase` over `kebab-case` for attributes

## 2. Let's get reactive
> Let's make the todo items editable & deletable. Also I want several todo lists.

Goals: 
- Breaking apart components.
- "Prop-drilling" 
- "Conditional renders"
